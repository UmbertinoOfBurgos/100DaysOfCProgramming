# 100DaysOfCProgramming
where i dive into the world of C

i intend to do this by going through the book C Programming: A Modern Approach by K.N.King. 
i might solve assignments and upload and i might not. i will also use AI to guide me. 
everyday should also have a readme file for itself just for me to recap things and jot down questions I have or things i need to look up for the next day.

#### Day 1:
Mostly played with AI and wasted a lot of time but read the first chapter of the book. Playing with AI was mostly making ciphers and text compression algorithms like caeser and huffman. Will go in depth on these in later dates. Tomorrow if I wake up early will solve 3 chapters and look at whatever I understand of the cipher code.
